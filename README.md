#  problem 1: WHATflix
King Shan is very fond of movies and wants to take his family for a movie. However, they canâ€™t agree on which movie to watch.
So King Shan declares a movie watching spree and takes each person to watch the movie they want. Your coding challenge
is to:
1. Build a Restful web service API which will accept a search string and userID and return unique movies in the order of
preference for that user.
2. Build a Restful web service API which will list out all the users and the top 3 recommended movies for each user based on
their preferences
Develop the application in a language of your choice and host the service in Cloud infrastructure like AWS/Heroku and give us
the url endpoints or a Postman project for the same.
